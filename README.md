# DSCI-532_2026_6_EPL_match_tracker

The EPL Match Tracker is an interactive dashboard developed by DSCI 532 Group 6 for visualizing and exploring English Premier League football match data. Our analysis segments the season into early, mid, and late periods to uncover performance trends, contrasts home and away metrics to assess venue impact, and evaluates tactical effectiveness using shot conversion rates and goal differences. The dashboard supports visual analytics to help users answer key questions about match dynamics and strategy, evolving through successive course milestones to include AI-powered features and advanced interactivity. 

For setup instructions and to run the dashboard locally, please see the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section of this README.
