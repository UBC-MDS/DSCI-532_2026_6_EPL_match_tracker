## Section 3: Research Questions & Usage Scenario

### Persona

The primary user of this dashboard is a team performance analyst or coach in the English Premier League. The coach aims to evaluate team performance using historical match data to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. In particular, they are interested in improving overall performance and analyzing scoring efficiency across different match contexts.

### Usage Scenario

A coach is reviewing team performance after switching tactics from a defensive approach to a more attacking style. They want to compare match outcomes and performance indicators before and after the tactical shift to understand whether the change led to increased offensive production (e.g., higher shots and goals) and whether it introduced trade-offs such as conceding more goals. The dashboard allows them to filter matches by season or time period and compare key metrics across these phases.

### User Stories

#### Story 1
As a coach/team analyst, I want to compare goals scored and shots taken before and after switching from a defensive to an attacking approach so that I can evaluate whether the tactical change improved offensive performance or contributed to a decline in results.

#### Story 2
As a coach/team analyst, I want to compare win rate, goals scored, and goals conceded in home versus away matches so that I can understand whether our performance significantly differs by venue and adjust match strategies accordingly.
